### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Harel]

With 10 years of diverse experience in therapies, client support, and team management, I am a highly adaptable and versatile professional looking to transition into the field of front-end web development. As a junior developer, I may not have extensive experience yet, but what I lack in experience, I make up for in passion and drive to learn. I am deeply passionate about creating responsive and beautiful websites using modern JavaScript, and I am constantly seeking to imporove my skills and knowledge in this field. I am a quick learner and a team player, and I am confident that my unique blend of skills and experience will make me an asset to any deveopment team. I am eager to take on new challeneges and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. I am looking for an opportunity to join a company where I can grow and learn as a front-end developer and where I can put my skills to use in real-world projects.
